<p>One of initial descriptions of project, then hosted at
http://github.com/nojs was</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sane language to produce javascript code that works in browser and
  on node.js</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some time passed, more experiments followed, and it became obvious
that this no-js kind of approach applies to a variety of topics and has a
number of pleasant implications. That was the time when project was
killed and nojs organization spawned at github under the same url.</p>
