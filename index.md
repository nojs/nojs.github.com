## What's The Buzz

One of initial descriptions of project, then hosted at
http://github.com/nojs was
> Sane language to produce javascript code that works in browser and
  on node .js

Some time passed, more experiments followed, and it became obvious
that this no-js kind of approach applies to a variety of topics and has a
number of pleasant implications. That was the time when project was
killed and nojs organization spawned at github under same url.
